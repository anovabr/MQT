# About GitBooks

  
**Getting started**
  
If you are convinced that this tool might benefit your teaching, your first point of action is to prepare your system for creating GitBooks (Chapter \@ref(prerequisites)). After that, you can get a copy of this GitBook as a template (Chapter \@ref(getgitbook)). Then, you can start tweaking it for your own course!
